# Almetry
Almetry is my simple function calculator. 
Operators:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponents
- Roots

Currently, Almetry can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and use parentheses. It can also follow PEMDAS. We use the Stack data structure to do this.

I plan to make a UI similar to a calculator like this:
